# Sort x Python
## Implementations of QuickSort and MergeSort in Python

### QuickSort
- We randomize the array before sorting to avoid worst case performance.
- We always choose the first element in the partition to be the pivot.

### MergeSort
- We use the bottom-up approach.
- We use a third array of size n to help with merging two subarrays of size n/2.
